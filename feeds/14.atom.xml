Some of them seem a whole lot more likely from 15 years in the future. To me the ideas on the appeal of US citizenship seems to already be starting to happen, with an economy where multiple citizenship and an ability to easily move and work is a competitive advantage. The US tax laws in particular don't endear me to becoming a US or dual citizen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The idea of squatter's suburbs, where the more affluent return in droves to city centers, driven in part by rising gas prices, and displace the poor appears to be a quite likely outcome now. Probably not such a trend a decade and a half ago.
