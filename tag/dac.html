<p>Many ideas have been whirling around in my head since being at DAC. I've been inspired to learn some new things, starting with the <a href="http://www.ovmworld.org/">Open Verification Methodology</a> but also revisiting some of the Electronic System Level tools and flows that I've worked with in the past. I'm interested in exploring visualization techniques and tools and how they might be applied to verification and design. I'd also like to learn more about a few of the more interesting formal verification tools, like <a href="http://www.onespin-solutions.com">OneSpin 360 MV</a> and maybe explore what is possible with ESL tools like <a href="http://www.bluespec.com/products/index.htm">Bluespec's SystemVerilog</a> flow or the various other similar tools that are out there.</p>

<p>I have a difficult time learning things just for the sake of it, tending to be more driven by necessity rather than idle curiosity. I've been doing some work based around a small CPU core and started getting frustrated with the way the CPU was architected. This led me to start considering designing my own CPU, just for fun. Partly as a motivation to crack open a Hennessy &amp; Patterson book that I've been meaning to read for a few years, partly to see if I can do it, partly as a vehicle to hang all those other ideas upon.</p>

<p>I've been looking around the web, browsing on <a href="http://opencores.org/">OpenCores</a> and finding humbling projects, such as <a href="http://homebrewcpu.org/">HomebrewCPU,</a> which is a Minix-compatible CPU entirely constructed from discrete gates. You can even browse the web pages that it is serving or telnet in to it! To my way of thinking, that is slightly nuts - impressive, but nuts all the same - five wire-wrapped boards to debug. My <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/McGregor:Gordon.html">background is in FPGAs</a> and that seems the perfect technology for this sort of exploration - I'm also thinking along the way that I might be able to play with synthesisable verification or FPGA enhanced verification/ emulation as well as possibly using this as a platform for a reconfigurable architecture. Lots of ideas, potential and possibilities. It will also give me a chance to re-engage with FPGA technologies and learn about more about the state of those tools. The various tools are getting to a fairly mature point and a simple pipelined CPU shouldn't require too much work but still be complex enough to do interesting things with.</p>

<p>I've been looking at <a href="http://www.xilinx.com">Xilinx</a> and <a href="http://www.altera.com">Altera </a>to get an understanding of their current tool flows and trying to work out language support and maturity - which would be the best option for systemVerilog, where the best simulation options are and that kind of thing. No real conclusions yet, but both have trial versions of what appears to be a complete tool chain, so I will probably drive a small example through both flows as a pipe cleaner.</p>

<p>Then of course there are the more fundamental religious issues - CISC or RISC, what ISA to use. Roll my own, pick up an already defined but open architecture, or something in between? I'm looking for suggestions in this respect - I know ARM are quite litigious when it comes to cloning their ISA, so I'll be avoiding that, but <a href="http://www.opensparc.net/">OpenSPARC</a> might well be a good option. Any other suggestions? I'm not sure if the early MIPS ISAs are cloneable without problems? Maybe I could go really back to my roots and implement a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zx81">Z80 architecture</a>. The advantage of picking on an existing ISA is that the tools come mostly for free. While porting gas and gcc to my own ISA could also be an interesting experiment and learning experience, it would probably be more of a distraction than I want.</p>

<p>I am a fan of the Python language and tend to write most of my <a href="http://gordonmcgregor.blogspot.com/2008/03/flickr-set-parser-for-gpsvisualizer.html">personal projects</a> in it. As a result, I'm intrigued by the potential for writing the core in Python, using some of the available extensions and libraries. Two packages seem to already exist, <a href="http://myhdl.jandecaluwe.com/doku.php">MyHDL</a> and <a href="http://pyhvl.sourceforge.net/">PyHVL</a>. MyHDL is Python extension to let you express parallel behaviour that can then be automatically translated to verilog or VHDL. PyHVL provides the other piece of the Python puzzle, enabling high-level verification in Python. So potentially I could do the design and verification in Python then drive through into an FPGA flow for implementation. <a href="http://www.coolverification.com/2008/06/ovm-world-summi.html">JL</a> jokingly mentioned the potential for an OVM port to Python but maybe it isn't such a crazy notion. The thing that Python is fantastic for is expressing complex ideas quickly and without a lot of fuss or housekeeping. From the verification perspective it seems to be a perfect match as I can focus more on the testing, and less on the language. I'm a bit more skeptical about using it on the design side but I think it might be worth a look.</p>

<p>To kick things off, I found the description for a <a href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b92029/data/EXP/mcpu-doc.pdf">minimal CPU</a> on opencores. This is a really basic 8-bit processor, 4 op codes, couple of registers and a very simple, small architecture, yet it can still do some useful function. This evening I wrote a Python ISS for it, just to prove out some ideas. Took about an hour to get a working cycle-based ISS together for the architecture. Of course, immediately the next thing you need is an assembler and that was fairly easy to put together in Python too. Nothing particularly complex, but a two pass assembler that supports labels and constants and generates code that runs on the core. I'm able to assemble and run the example greatest common divisor (Dijkstra's algorithm) described in the paper and it has given me a good indication of the direction to go. So far, my couple of hour project can assemble and execute the following code:</p>

<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">start:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; NOR allone&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; akku == 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; NOR b<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ADD one&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; akku = -b<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ADD a&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ; akku = a - b<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ; Carry set when akku &gt;= 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; JCC neg<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; STA a<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ADD allone&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; JCC end&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; A=0 ? -&gt; end, result in b<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; JCC start<br /><br />neg:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; NOR zero<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ADD one&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;; Akku = -Akku<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; STA b<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; JCC start&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ; carry not altered<br /><br />end:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; JCC end<br /><br />a: 10&nbsp; ; a &amp; b are the two values to consider<br />b: 30<br /><br />allone: 0xff&nbsp; ; various constants<br />zero:&nbsp; &nbsp;0<br />one:&nbsp; &nbsp; 1</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Next step is to describe this trivial core in a synthesisable form and see how I get on running it through one or two FPGA flows. A few tests and some verification could be useful too! For FPGAs I'm much more used to the general <em>suck it and see </em>style of testing that is the norm. Synthesize, place and route and see if it works. In the last several years I've been working on much larger ASICs so have certainly seen the value of more robust verification and I think FPGA technology has probably spent too much time as the wild frontier of design robustness and testing. As this project progresses I want to explore what the best balance is for testing and how the test environments can use the FPGA to accelerate testing along the way.</p>

<p>So plenty of things up in the air but I think this could be fun.</p>

<p>I've had an on again/ off again interest in visualization tools to enhance design and verification for many years. I've written log file parsers to show data in a more friendly way to enhance debug, or TCL/Tk widgets that demonstrate activity on bus ports of a SystemC AMBA switch model. Tools that at first glance might seem somewhat pointless visual trinkets can really enhance debug, by letting the brain search for patterns more easily within data. For example, with the bus switch, it was visually easy to see which bus wasn't getting any traffic, which could have been extracted from a log, but would have required more thought. Patterns of burstiness or busyness can also be seen quite easily. Similar results can usually be achieved with grep or clever regular expressions, but I find I end up having to keep a lot more data in my head, which pushes out the brainpower I might apply to actually working on the real problem.</p>

<p>Well written visualisations present the data in a more accessible way, letting you get to the problems more quickly. A good example of these from the recent DAC are a couple of OCP tools by <a href="http://www.duolog.com/">Duolog</a>. The tools present typical OCP information in a more easily interpretable way, <a href="http://www.duolog.com/products/ocp-toolkit/conductor">colouring related transactions in a log file</a>, or <a href="http://www.duolog.com/products/ocp-toolkit/tracker">showing bus bandwidth</a>. It is much simpler to trace a series of transactions this way, or find buses that are being starved or overloaded. The information could have been directly extracted from the log file by the user, but the visualisations make things easier and quicker.</p>

<p>I've been playing around with&nbsp; <a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/">Flash</a> and also just started reading about the <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> language over the weekend. Co-incidentally, I happened across these <a href="http://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ogawa/codeswarm/">visualisations of version control commits</a> for several large projects, written in Processing. These give a good indication of how visualisations can show a lot of very complex data in a more accessible way. <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1093745">The Python visualisation</a> was particularly interesting to show how few contributers there were until an explosion of contributions around the year 2000 wander on to the stage.</p>

<p>As our SoC designs keep getting larger, I believe that more accessible means to interpret the verification and design data and results will be needed, beyond just waveforms and log traces. I would be interested to see what the ebb and flow of check-ins look like for a complex, modern SoC. We tend to think that hardware design is just the same as software design by another name, but you might start to see structural differences in how the code and modifications organise themselves. </p>

<p>The Python case shows one leader, banging away on their own, suddenly joined en mass when the code base becomes popular. SoCs will also probably demonstrate Conway's Law visually, mirroring the organisational structure that put the design together. Pairs of verification and design engineers working together, sub-assemblies, clustering around organisational and functional boundaries. The vast majority of changes would be much more localised than you see in a large software project such as Python. Quite possibly other software projects fall along similar modular designs but it would be instructive to see the visualisations side by side - perhaps with the organisational (or lack of) human structure overlaid.</p>
