<p>Just installed <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv3/index.php">dd-wrt</a> on my Linksys wrt54g wireless router. I'd been meaning to do this for a while - as an easy way to get a much more functional router than the default firmware shipped by Linksys. What finally motivated me to do it was the recent storm about Time Warner Cable introducing <a href="http://austinist.com/2009/04/16/time_warners_consumption_based_bill.php">bandwidth caps in Austin</a>. Although TWC seem to have backed down for the moment, they have also recently started <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/04/25/1237215&amp;from=rss">disconnecting customers for 'using too much bandwidth'</a> on their infinite bandwidth contracts. The DD-WRT firmware gives me an independent way to monitor my usage and get an idea of how much I typically transmit &amp; receive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The DD-WRT firmware install wasn't quite as smooth as the documentation might make you believe. The first time I installed and then tried to update the firmware, I got a fairly unhelpful 'Error 2: Access violation' error from the tftp prompt and not much else. I went back through the management mode initial vxkiller upload and things seemed to work better the second time around. For a while I was worried that I had a brick of router.</p>

<p>Once back up and running, the settings were very similar to the previous Linksys options, so it was quite quick to get the wireless settings and port forwarding, DMZ etc that I was using previously reconfigured. Now I have historical and realtime graphs of bandwidth usage available. Should be interesting to be able to monitor what's going on. If they are cutting people off for using 44GB per week and saying that is <em>“that is more than most people use in a year”</em> I am a little concerned at my 7.2GB in one day. That was a few <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/index.php">iPhone development videos from Stanford</a> and then we watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0830515/">Quantum of Solace</a> last night on the Xbox. Seems like Time Warner consider that aberrant behaviour.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to attend a seminar from <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</a>, a couple of weeks ago, on the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses">Presentation of Data and Information</a>. Edward Tufte is probably best known for the book '<em><a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">The Quantitative Display of Visual Information</a></em>' and was an engaging and entertaining presenter. He has a very different style from the normal Powerpoint-driven presentation approach. In fact, much of his work is railing against the uses and abuses of Powerpoint and similar slide techniques.</p>

<p>The main take-away I got from the whole day was that if you have to communicate complicated data sets or information, that you really need to consider how people will use and interact with the data first. Too often, we go straight to presentation software and start trying to work out how to express the information in slides, rather than taking the time to consider if there are other, better ways to impart the information. Tufte was very keen on the concept of a 'super-graphic' which is a data rich, high resolution physical handout that lets participants see and consider a lot of data at once. A map is a great example of a super-graphic, or the weather page in a typical newspaper. A key part of this is that paper is much higher resolution than a typical computer screen (72dpi to 600dpi means you can show a whole lot more data in the same space). This is why multiple display screens are really useful for serious work. It also means that printing out and sharing data is a great way to get information infront of people in a meeting, rather than drip feeding it from slides)</p>

<p>I compare this idea to another guide I saw in the same week on creating powerpoint presentations that admonishes that there should never be more than 8 numbers on any slide or graphic. Tufte's response to this was repeatedly '<em>when did we become so stupid, just because we walked into a business meeting?</em>' People handle large, complex data displays every day in the real world. People read and study sports scores in a newspaper, or financial reports without any trouble at all.</p>

<p>Let the data drive the presentation format, rather than the presentation software drive how the data is displayed.</p>

</p>

<p>Attended the <a href="http://www.coolverification.com/2008/03/blogging-birds.html">blogging Birds of Feather</a> session at DAC, last evening. I was quite amazed at the number of people who showed up. I had expected there to be half a dozen people and not much interest. Instead, more chairs had to be brought in and in the end about 40 people showed up, with many traditional journalists and bloggers in attendance. The discussion was lively and spirited. </p>

<p>One of the main themes was confusion over just what blogging is and how it should fit in to the more traditional roles of the press and marketing with the EDA world. Some of the discussion revolved around trying to classify just what a blog is or isn't and how it differs from columns, marketing or opinion pieces. To me this seems a mostly futile debate or perhaps one that stems from a lack of real understanding on what the medium is about. Really all a blog is is a way of having a somewhat one-sided or asymmetric conversation. The classification or editorial style then comes from the person who runs the blog. Columns, <a href="http://stephenfry.com/blog/">blessays</a>, technical paper sources, marketing fluff pieces, lunchable debates, it is all blogging and reflects the writer of the blog. At the lowest level, a blog is really just an easy mechanism to publish on-line. Everything else becomes an issue of personal approach, rather than definition over the technical nature of the communications medium.</p>

<p>There was also quite a bit of concern over editorial control and company influence. Certainly it is clear that one of the main differences that a blog has over what has gone before is the democratization of content creation. The barriers to entry have been stripped away and anyone with something to say can start saying it. It is analogous to the changes with the automated printing press and how that lowered the cost of entry to distribute ideas. But anyone being able to publish isn't always a good thing. Professional writers and editors perform a useful function, giving an expectation for a certain level of quality.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Now, editorial control over the content is removed. But editors are valuable - they are a filter on the content. That filter finds interesting articles and also maintains quality. A blog removes that or shifts the onus onto the writer to be their own editor. EDA blogging isn't going to be immune to the wide range of quality and value that exists in the mainstream blogosphere. Some blogs will be terrible. Some will be great. The advantage is that my definition of what is great and interesting might be radically different to yours, so I'll be able to find the content that is valuable to me, rather than what an editor thinks I need to hear. </p>

<p>Control and classification again was brought up when the issue of the 60+ EDA blogs was mentioned. The concern was that so many disparate sources of information need to be corralled and filtered, otherwise nobody could read them or keep up. Here again, I think this is a bit of a red herring. There will be a large number of EDA blogs that will appear, but I'll personally probably only care about the content of a small percentage of them. It is exactly the same as when I come to DAC. There might be 500 companies here, but I'm not interested in the products that many or even most of them have. I personally filter out all the low level layout, silicon process technology companies and concentrate on the ones relevant to me. EDA blogs will be the same - I'll find the 5 or 10 that cover my areas of interest and read those. The beauty is that you can also find the (no doubt very different) 5 or 10 that cover your area of interest and watch those. You have the control over the content you are exposed to, rather than having <a href="http://www.eetimes.com">EE Times</a> select across the whole EDA sphere, which then provides maybe one article per issue that actually covers part of the industry that I care about.</p>

<p>Along the same lines, there is no real reason that someone couldn't step up and start aggregating the content in useful ways, collecting and collating interesting content from other
sources. Reputation tends to be the driver for this. If I find someone who writes interesting content I'll tend to follow their interests too. If they point to another article or blog, I'll read that. They then are providing the role of a more traditional editor to the content I read. The only real change is that there will be a lot more editors and authors, so we can all find the more personalised channel that suits our interest. </p>

<p>My experiences aggregating content for SoFoBoMo (<a href="http://gordonmcgregor.blogspot.com/2008/01/sofobomo.html">Solo Photographic Book in a Month</a>) is illustrative for this. In a couple of months, we established a group of 200 people working an indivdual book project, all working on their own project, concurrently, in the same month. Many of the participants also blogged about their experiences creating their first (for those new to the process) or latest book. Everyone was working on a similar process, but on their own personal work. <a href="http://gordonmcgregor.blogspot.com/2008/04/pipes.html">I set up simple tools</a> that pulled from all of the participants blogs and provide one, very focused, feed specifically about this shared project. Those people may well have been blogging about what they had for lunch or where they went at the weekend, but only the relevant <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/gordonmcgregor/sofobomo">entries about SoFoBoMo</a> appeared in the feed. It would certainly be quite trivial to do something similar for hot EDA topics too. I could do that and publish it and become a hub for those conversations. There is a world of free tools out there just to do this task. A feed that combed all the EDA blogs for ESL topics or OVM or whatever buzzwords you are interested in is trivial to set up and would deliver customised content on a daily basis. Certainly not all readers will set this up, but it only takes one person to do it and share it for everyone to benefit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vmmcentral.org/vmartialarts/">Janick Bergeron</a> raised some interesting concerns common to most bloggers, on how to maintain the flow of content. There have been <a href="http://writetodone.com/">a lot of articles</a> written on how to<a href="http://http://writetodone.com/2008/01/10/what-makes-great-blogwriting/"> feed the beast</a>, with <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2006/02/14/blogging-for-beginners-2/">blogs devoted</a> to these sorts of topics. This isn't really an EDA blogging or even a blogging specific topic, but one common to anyone who writes. Passion has to be the driver, particularly for a personal outlet that isn't corporately funded or part of a job. I think it is hard to fake a blog - you have to want to do it, enjoy writing and have something to say. There are certainly mechanisms <a href="http://writetodone.com/2008/03/03/31-ways-to-find-inspiration-for-your-writing/">to help</a> discover content or processes you can put in place to make it more of a habit, but you have to want to do it at a fundamental level. My <a href="http://gordonmcgregor.blogspot.com">blog on photography</a> exists because I'm interested in discussing the topic. I want to share the ideas and learn from others following a similar path. I write it now because I can't stop writing it and I enjoy the process of ordering my thoughts. <a href="http://www.xuropa.com/ixuropa_home.php"><br /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.xuropa.com/ixuropa_home.php">James Colgan</a> and I had an interesting conversation on what topics make sense for blogging. I think there can be an initial fear that you have to be an expert in a particular topic to be able to talk about it. That can certainly be one approach. But there can be a lot of value to others in describing a learning process. You can become a guide for those who are following the same path if you point out the pitfalls that you fell into along the way. I used <a href="http://gordonmcgregor.blogspot.com/search/label/strangers">my experiences photographing strangers</a> as an example - 18 months ago I started blogging about my attempts to get better at taking pictures of people I didn't know. My early efforts were painful but I kept talking about how it improved over time. Some of those articles are amongst the more popular and valuable ones that I've written - because others who are earlier on that learning curve can see what I did over time. Similarly, in the EDA industry I could see that an expert on OVM blogging about use of the methodology would be fascinating. I could also see that a blog written about the frustrations of trying to learn to use the OVM for the first time would be of value. The expert has already probably forgotten the details that the new user might get hung up on and maybe wouldn't even know about the common mistakes that would be made. There is value to both and sharing that sort of experience.</p>

<p>Overall this was a really interesting and fun session. Kudos to JL for pushing to make it happen and to everyone who attended and made it such a lively discussion.</p>

<p>As I've started working on this small CPU project, one of the first decisions I've been considering has been which version control system to use. I've been a user of subversion for most of my personal projects for several years now and am currently using it at a client. As a result I'm quite familiar with the ins and outs of using it on a variety of sizes of projects. I've become more aware of distributed systems, such as <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> and <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</a> over the last year, but haven't really been able to get my head around the advantages of them. In particular, the quote below from Linus Torvalds has been in the back of my mind.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 1.4em;"><em>"The slogan of Subversion for a while was 'CVS done right</em><em>', or something like that, and if you start with that kind of slogan, there's nowhere you can go. There is no way to do CVS right."</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">- Linus Torvalds</p>

<p>One of the main source control issues I've seen on several of the projects I've worked on has been the aversion to branches that most users have. Typically there is a big central source repository that everyone will check out from. You then develop in your own little world. When the particular piece of work is complete, you check it back in. Usually, there is a fairly high barrier or cost to those commits, with sets of test suites that you must pass before you can commit your code back to the central repository. The checks take hours to run and you can not check back in until your code passes all the tests. Otherwise everyone else is at risk. But I always found that if I was working on something non-trivial, I'd really like to make some progress and check point that half way, committing it in to just a local branch, then working on further. That would give me the confidence to make larger changes, safe in the knowledge I can revert back to a midway working point. That's what a branch would be for, after all, but not if they are hard to make and not if the commit cost is so high. So we never did that, working for days or weeks before committing any changes.</p>

<p>The second common frustration I've seen with a centralized repository occurs when two people are working closely together on a piece of the system. This happens to characterise almost every verification endeavor, for example. By common definition, the verification and design work should be done by two different people, just to get extra eyes on the spec. This avoids duplicating erroneous assumptions about the design and is fundamental to the whole process. As a consequence, we are almost always faced with the situation where changes need to be made by two or more people, in distinct parts of the code (e.g., testbench and rtl) but cannot be checked in because of mutual dependencies. The changes depend on each other and all the commit checks will fail for either change on its own. Various ways around this exist, disabling affected checks in the commit scripts, copying files into each others workspaces and other hacks. All because fundamentally the centralised server approach, with costly branches and high commit costs, doesn't really let this sort of work proceed in an effective way.</p>

<p>The third frustration is the general speed of the repository. Time to check things out, time to do merges, how long it takes to do a diff or an update. These operations can usually mean a break for coffee or a walk around while the tool fetches the changes, compares them and attempts to merge it all together. Compound that by working in remote sites or across multiple geographic locations.</p>

<p>Git claims to solve these problems and be a whole lot faster at the same time.</p>

<p>The key is in breaking away from a centralised server. The database is distributed to every developer. As a result, everyone works on their own branch by default. Making further branches is trivial, because they don't get sent to every other developer. Fewer issues with namespace collisions when naming a branch, no real concern about checking code in and someone else getting your partially finished work. Earlier today I'd listened to <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/">Jeff Atwood</a> <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3710.html">talking</a> about the fact that Git makes branching trivial, but I didn't really understand why until I <a href="ttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8">watched a really interesting presentation</a> from Linus Torvalds on the subject. It is supposed to be a talk about Git, but really he focuses almost exclusively on the advantages of a distributed repository. I'd initially thought the real advantage was the '<em>always available</em>' nature of a distributed repository, so that you could work on a plane or generally away from a network and still be able to check in, look at histories and all the things you normally need the central server access for. That's certainly part of the reason why it is interesting, but the branching and merging cost reduction that Git claims to offer is a much bigger deal.</p>

<p>For my second source of frustration above, Git also provides a solution. As there is no central repository, everyone can pull and push data to each other. The verification engineer and designer can exchange files more easily, through a tracked, version controlled system, rather than the usual sideband exchanges or hacks to the check-in scripts. Git also addresses that third issue, because all of the files are local and it has been designed for performance. Network overhead isn't an issue for a <em>diff</em> or history request as you have all the data locally. Merges are similarly less painful. The claimed performance is impressive and part of the reason why I want to try Git out.</p>
<p>Now, the most glaring problem with all this is that it sounds like anarchy. There is no central organisation, check-ins can happen any time, so where did all the quality assurance go? Linus talks about the network of trust relationships in his presentation. But, you can still have acceptance tests on when you actually pull data from a particular user or set of users. You can require them to run a battery of tests before they are allowed to share their work with the rest of the project. The usual checks and balances can be put back in place for when the whole database gets reassembled, but the individual developers or groups of designers can work more efficiently in a sub-repository. Git also supports hierarchical projects that combine various blocks of code, in fact that seems to be the preferred use model. Each sub-system on a design would be a unique Git repository. It could be even broken down further and have each IP block in their own repository. The general approach that has been used in the past, with quality checks, can still be used with some changes, as a gate to when larger mergers take place. This probably requires some trusted people in the organisation to act as gatekeepers or guardians for each level, but the basic methodology shouldn't be too difficult to layer on top.</p>
<p>You can read a lot more about Git on the <a href="http://git.or.cz/">homepage,</a> including conversion documents from other common source control systems and details on the actual commands to use. Looking through the <a href="http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html">SVN conversion document</a>, the git command syntax appears a bit cleaner and generally more intuitive to me. I also played around with the <em>merge</em> and <em>diff</em> tools and they seem powerful. It was very easy to create and populate a repository, for example. I plan on using it for the next few projects I work on to get a feel for how really useful it is and where the issues are hidden.</p>
<p>Edit to add: I found this <a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitSvnComparsion">draft version of the differences</a> between Git and Subversion quite useful.</p>

<p><p style="text-align: right;"><i>-</i> R. W. Emerson</p>

<p>Looking over the VPI iterator sample code I posted last night from PyHVL, I noticed something. I've defined the API as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8">
  <pre style="line-height: 125%">
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">vpi_iterator</span>(handle, type<span style="color: #666666">=</span>vpiNet):
</pre>
</div>With the <i>handle</i> first and an optional <i>type</i> parameter second, taking the default value of <i>vpiNet</i>. Looking again at the C implementation, I see that the method signature is the reverse:<br />
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8">
  <pre style="line-height: 125%">
itr <span style="color: #666666">=</span> vpi_iterate(vpiNet, mod);
</pre>
</div>Now, I'm faced with a decision. I could make the Python <i>vpi_iterator()</i> call consistent with the similar C API, and reverse the parameters, or I can keep it the same way. Keeping it the same way allows the use of the default argument for <i>vpiNet</i>. Optional arguments must follow required arguments, so I couldn't reverse it and keep the <i>type</i>=<i>vpiNet</i> as an option, it would have to become <i>(type, handle).</i> In this case, I don't think the default type is particularly intuitive from the name, so I would tend to think there is more value in reversing the arguments, so that it is consistent with the C API's similar function signature.<br />
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8">
  <pre style="line-height: 125%">
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">vpi_iterator</span>(type, handle):
</pre>
</div>Some people might think this is a totally arbitrary consideration. I believe this sort of detail is important. My favorite languages are internally consistent, so that when you start using a new library or part of the language, the structures and idioms are so familiar you can often code things correctly without having fully read the documentation. Most of the Python standard library is like that, you can pick up a new library and be productive, quickly, because there aren't jarring inconstancies. If I want people to use this <i>vpi_iterator</i> method, coming from C, it will help if it matches the general argument patterns used there. Less friction to getting code working first time.<br />
Each of these is just a small thing that you have to remember, but each time it catches you out it is annoying and maybe knocks you off your train of thought to fix it. The details and consistency are important to people being productive in a language.<br />
<br />
I wish SystemVerilog had more of that consistency - semicolons to mark the end of a function definition, then a <i>begin/end</i> syntax for blocks, or <i>{}</i> for some parts of the language to define blocks. <i>end, endfunction, endtask</i>. Just extra details that get in the way of writing clean code the first time.<br />

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mcgregorphoto">I take a lot of pictures</a>. On occasion, I get too impatient when downloading images from my compact flash cards. I'll swap the card without ejecting it properly and sometimes the cards get corrupted. Typically, when that happens the file allocation table of the previous card that was in the reader gets written onto the new card, or the FAT gets corrupted in some other way. The images are still there, but you can't access them. This happened to me last weekend and I didn't have any recovery software on this laptop. I had a look around online and the only recovery programs I could find were close to $100. I had a bit of free time so I decided to try writing my own instead. Turns out a basic recovery tool is actually really simple to put together.</p>

<p>A couple of things made it possible to do quite simple image recovery, successfully. Firstly, I always format the cards in the camera before I use them. So I know when the camera is writing images to the cards, the card is empty. Secondly, I never delete images in the camera. This means there is no fragmentation on the drive. The images are simply stored sequentially on the memory. The FAT format is fairly simple, based on sectors that are multiples of 512 bytes in size, that are collected together in clusters that vary depending on the disk formating. Images are written into linked lists of those clusters. Potentially the clusters could be fragmented across the drive, particularly if images are deleted and new ones stored on the disk. With a clean start and no images deleted, it is reasonable to assume that the images will just be stored on concurrent clusters. I think damaged sectors are managed at the a physical level on the disks, so they are mapped out of the available space (feel free to correct me on this). Anyway, with these assumptions made, it is possible to write a simple tool to parse a disk image and extract images, with a high likelihood of a successful result.</p>

<p>The first step is to get the data. I did the recovery on a unix system and used <em>dd</em> to get the initial image. You have to dump the actual physical device, not one of the disk partitions (as those are essentially what has become corrupt)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">d<em>d if=/dev/rdisk1 of=image.img bs=512</em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The block size is set to 512 to match the formating of the compact flash card. This step takes a while, but eventually you'll have an image file, <em>image.img</em> which is a low level copy of the data on the drive. The next step is to work out a way to identify the files you are looking to recover. I wrote a simple hex dump tool that prints the first few bytes of a file. I used this on a representative sample of the Canon <em>cr2</em> RAW files to get a search key to identify the start of a file.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">--- show_header.py ---</p>

<blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: left;"></p>

  <p style="text-align: left;"><em>import sys</em></p>

  <p style="text-align: left;"><em>file = open(sys.argv[1], 'rb')</em></p>

  <p style="text-align: left;"><em>header = file.read(12)</em></p>

  <p style="text-align: left;"><em>headerhex = header.encode('hex')</em></p>

  <p style="text-align: left;"><em>print headerhex</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>--- end show_header.py ---</p>

<p>This little bit of python can be applied to a group of files with xargs</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>ls *.cr2 | xargs -n 1 python show_header.py</em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">From that output, it is easy enough to find a representive number of bytes that can be used to identify the start of a file. I also had recorded some audio with the camera, so did a similar process with .wav files to extract them correctly.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Then all you have to do is iterate through the disk image in <em>block_size</em> chunks, checking for those file signatures at the start of each sector. When you find a file signature, start dumping all the data to a new file, until you find another signature. That's all there is to it. Note that there are no warranties with this. I'm offering no guarantees that it will work, or even will not wipe your computer. <strong>Use at your own risk</strong>. With this I was able to recover the 150+ images that I'd taken and several audio files. It actually works surprisingly quickly once the disk image has been made. Also worth mentioning that the JPEG header matching is untested, as I didn't have any JPEG files on this particular disk, but is included here for completeness.</p>

If you do want to actually develop and test applications on an iPhone or iPod Touch, you'll need to pay the $99 developer fee to get the encryption keys that let you run applications on a phone and allows you to submit apps for the app store. At least for the basics, the simulator is useful as a target platform for testing, although there are differences between it and the final platform. (features such as multi-touch and the accelerometer are hard to test for example, unless you want to start shaking your computer).</p>

<p>Lifehacker recently <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/education/technophilia-get-a-free-college-education-online-201979.php">had an article</a> on all of the educational resources that are becoming available on the web, for free. iTunesU is a good example of the sort of teaching resources that are out there, if you look. The quality is variable, but there are some excellent resources if you are prepared to dig.</p>

                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>Thomas J. Watson, the president of IBM,  once famously <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson">didn't say</a> that <em>I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.</em> He is still widely quoted as having said it and it is usually trotted out as a good example of why we shouldn't make predictions about the future of technology. Mainly because those predictions almost always will make us look entirely foolish. The title of this blog is based on that quote, in the hope that it'll discourage me from making too many painful statements about what I think the future of EDA and verification might be, but that's what this blog is going to be about.</p>

<p>Electronic design automation and functional verification are two pieces of the puzzle aiming to help close the design gap in the semiconductor industry. That's the gap between the amount of transistors we can put on a piece of silicon and the amount of transistors we can usefully put together to produce a working system that does something useful, in a reasonable period of time. The device physics guys have done a great job of getting well ahead of what we can usefully design. The main gap doesn't really seem to be what can be designed, though. It is what can be tested and verified to actually do what it is supposed to do.</p>

<p>There are more challenges further down the pipe too, timing closure looms ever larger as a problem, further reduction in geometries threaten the basic assumptions that let us typically ignore the nasty analog reality and pretend we are in some digital fantasy of ones and zeros. Those are all big problems or at least getting bigger, but functional verification is swallowing vast amounts of engineering time on projects right now and we seem to be getting ever further behind the curve. ( I feel already that I've made two potential <em>5 computers</em> kind of statements in just this one paragraph.) EDA tools keep promising great leaps forward, but we still seem to be seeing the same promises and not so much progress. Raising the abstraction level of the design languages, increasing the quality of the verification, more reuse and large amounts of money invested in creating IP, but largely the industry still appears to be where it was 10 years ago - just with more people working ever harder on each product.</p>

<p>The one saving grace in all this is that there is quite the demand for semiconductor devices. If you start counting up all the computers, portable devices, smart cars and embedded processors in use around your life,  you'll probably quite quickly realise you've maxed out that world market for 5 computers all on your own. In fact it is probably closer to 50 computers or computing devices in use around you. So at least the demand for products is there, even if we aren't quite sure how to design them all effectively, yet.</p>
