<p>I've been poking around at the <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-API-Documentation">Twitter API</a>, in part just out of curiosity about what features are exposed. I have an interest in writing some visualisation widgets based upon it. The iPhone development course is also using a Twitter client as something of a 'hello world' app, too. Today, Tim O'Reilly pointed to a <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/04/wordle-visualization-timoreilly-tweetstream.html">wordle visualisation</a> of all the things that he's tweeted and <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576594/">gave a link</a> to some code that could be used to download everything you'd tweeted. I had a look at it and decided to write something similar, using the Twitter API directly, rather than scraping the Twitter site.</p>

<p>The Twitter API I've been using is the excellent, minimalist <a href="http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/">python twitter tools</a> by Mike Verdone. The main advantage over other python Twitter APIs is that ptt doesn't redefine any of the API calls. It does exactly what it says in the published <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-API-Documentation">Twitter API</a>. As a result, it is incredibly easy to use. The 100 or so lines it is implemented in are also a very instructive read, to <a href="http://github.com/sixohsix/twitter/blob/ea668dec2e122000b0025a8cfc02c860388f621d/twitter/api.py">see how it is put together</a>. I think it is a great example of how the attributes in Python can be used.</p>

<p>The code I wrote is <a href="http://www.mcgregorphoto.com/pub/what_did_you_say.py.txt">available for download</a>. It respects the rate limiting imposed by Twitter and will output all of the tweets for a particular user, to a file called &lt;username&gt;.tweet in the file it is run from. You can change which users are fetched in the main() ftn. The resulting text file can be opened up and then copy/ pasted over into the <a href="http://www.wordle.net/create">wordle creator.</a></p>

<p>DAC started early with a Mentor sponsored breakfast at 7:30. Got to see a bit about some of their testbench automation tools that help steer coverage to more interesting parts of the design. There are a few other companies here that have similar products. The aim is to move beyond user driven constrained random testing and let the tools help in solving the problem.</p>

<p>After that, I listened to Gary Smith on the state of the EDA industry. Highlights:</p>

<ul><li>It's all about the software</li>

<li>Threads are dead</li>

<li>C is finished to be replaced by some useful concurrent language - brush up on Occam I say</li>

<li>Verification is a solved problem and will be automated - don't bother being a verification engineer</li>

<li>Almost 38% of companies roll their own EDA tools</li></ul>

<p>His talk made for an interesting start to the day, at least.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the day attending various sessions and tool demos, which I'll write more about later. I've been surprised how low attendance is. There are a lot of people from the tool companies in their booths, but not many customers for them to talk to - and that was on Monday, the free attendance day when there aren't that many technical sessions or other distractions. </p>

<p>The Open Verification Methodology(OVM) is a hot item this year, with many sessions discussing issues around use and interoperability. Many vendors are showing products or claiming compatibility with this new standard. SystemVerilog is the other dominant theme though SystemC still has some traction. The last time I was at DAC SystemC was the new kid on the block that everyone was expecting to take over the world, not so much any more and it has settled into a system level modeling niche. </p>

<p>The disturbing thing I am seeing is how little progress has been made in the last decade in the ESL tool industry. Many years ago I was working on ARM926 designs that were not on the bleeding edge, even then. Today, many ESL companies are still just showing support for ARM9 or being excited about performance of their ARM7 models. That's at least 2 or 3 cycles behind the latest processor technologies and a huge leap in tool complexity to keep up. Synthesis capacities are rising much slower than the process technologies, tools companies are stalling out, reimplementing the same technologies to support systemC, systemVerilog or what ever the new hot language or methodology is, without apparently making any significant progress.</p>

<p>The other problem that the ESL companies face is the lack of models for their particular product line. Many seem to be falling into the same trap - expecting customer demand to dictate which models to develop. But that isn't going to work - the systems designers need the models right around when they decide they need the models. There is no lead time. There certainly isn't the 6 months to 1 year lead time it takes to find the right ESL company, negotiate and convince them to start creating a model, get the team together and write and verify the model, then deliver it back to the system architect. When the architect wants the model, there might be a 1 week lead time. Maybe a month, before serious work needs to start. The whole investigation better be mostly finished in 6 months. ESL companies need to seed their model libraries in anticipation of customer need. If they wait for the customer, they'll always be too late to be any use at all and keep going round that loop. In spite of that glaring hole, ESL is another hot ticket at DAC this year. Software design and implementation continues to increase in cost and complexity and HW/SW co-design companies are proliferating as a result.</p>

<p>With the apparent dearth of progress and lack of useful model or up-to-date models, I'm not too surprised that almost 40% of companies are looking inwards for their EDA tools. Might also explain where everyone is this year, too. </p>

<p>The one bright light in the ESL space is that although many of the tools and methodologies haven't changed much in the last 5 years, they do seem to have moved on from being all smoke and mirrors and snake oil to perhaps actually working. So maybe things haven't changed, they've just become real.</p>

<p>Recently I've been <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-ap09056/index.html">reading</a> about the various open-source Continuous Integration servers that are available. <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CC/CI+Feature+Matrix">This chart</a> gives a good feature comparision of many of the systems that are out there. <a href="http://www.verilab.com" title="Verilab, Inc.">We've</a> been evaluating <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">Cruise Control</a> on some internal projects and generally trying to understand what the issues are with deploying a CI server on a hardware design project. One of the things I've been struggling with is the real, meaningful difference between continuous integration and the more typical <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000023.html">daily build</a> and check-in smoke tests. Scheduled builds are often described as an <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-ap03048/index.html?S_TACT=105AGX02&amp;S_CMP=EDU">anti-pattern</a> when considering CI, but as far as I can tell the only practical difference is in the frequency of the builds. Certainly, you have the potential to find out about a broken build more quickly with CI, hence it has less chance to impact other users. Also, you are always doing <em>useful</em> work, rather than maybe re-running a version because no check-in has happened since the previous build. However, these distinctions of implementing CI are maybe more significant in the software world than for the typically longer build times found in hardware design projects. This then is the key point - build time is the significant factor in CI. The real benefit of using CI successfully is that you need to refine your processes to keep the build as quick as possible, striving for close to a <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">10 minute turnaround time</a>, to stop things getting backed up. The consequence of this is that the entire Checkout-Build-Test loop keeps being optimised and refined. This doesn't just help with automated processes but can significantly improve productivity for the developers who do these steps manually every day. That's great for the software world, but is it really practical for hardware design with the current compilers and the speed of typical RTL simulation? If not, is it worth even bothering with?</p>

<p>The source control tools you choose can have a big impact on the first phase of the Checkout-Build-Test loop. When an update can take quarter an hour or longer, the source control system can become a significant productivity drain and stymie any chance of a quick turnaround. If merging changes, updating source and checking in a new revision takes hours, then there are real problems with the process and you certainly won't be doing multiple checkins per day (another fundamental CI process axiom is at minimum daily checkins for all developers, even more frequent is preferable). In <a href="http://www.fivecomputers.com/2008/06/git---version-c.html">Linus' talk about Git</a>, he describes being able to do a diff and merge on an entire kernel source tree (22k source files) in <a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/LinusTalk200705Transcript">less than a second</a>. I've used other SCM environments with similar amounts of code, where an update might take 30 minutes. These sorts of differences can significantly change how you work. It isn't just a matter of the time that the particular automated task takes, but what the developer does while they are waiting, reading email, writing documentation, switching context to other distractions.</p>

<p>Similarly, if the build takes half an hour or longer before it fails with a trivial syntax error, you'll have switched to something else and then have to try to mentally context switch back again to work on the problem. Each of these switches have an associated, measurable attention and productivity hit. Improving the build step can have a big impact on how you <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/06/13/zerstreutheit-and-attention-management-cure">manage your attention</a> and keep engaged with the development process. A faster turnaround can stave off the onset of <em><a href="http://www.43folders.com/comment/337830/literal-translation-Zerstreutheit">Zerstreutheit</a></em>.</p>

<p>The final Test step is significantly slower for hardware design. Often this is used as a justification not to bother optimising the Checkout and Build phases, because they are comparatively much shorter. A multi-day or week long regression might fool you into thinking that an hour long build is relatively good. However, simulation &amp; testing is the one step where the developer can be more out of the loop, with less impact. Typically, the user is not so tightly coupled into the testing loop, once the initial bugs are ironed out. Automation can certainly help here too, re-running failing tests with waveform dumping enabled or increased logging, to present a useful working environment for debug when the developer does come back to look at the fails.</p>

<p>The point really is that there is still a significant advantage to be had in spending effort to optimize the SCM and compile stages in a development flow, to maximise designer productivity and attention, even if the simulation time is large. Also a <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-ap11297/index.html?S_TACT=105AGX02&amp;S_CMP=EDU">build pipeline</a> can be used in the CI server to stage the build and testing feedback, to further mitigate the length of time that running tests takes. Deploying CI brings attention to how long these processes take and might help improve the entire development environment. Having fast enough tools can help the developers keep focused on what they are doing, without breaks for swordfights or reading email. Optimizing the build is still important, even in a hardware design environment, even when the runtime for regressions might be in terms of days or weeks. You might think the build process is only a comparatively small part of the overall runtime for a regression, but the designers spend most of their time looping through that comparatively small part.</p>

<p>So what is the take away? Does CI have a place in a hardware design flow? I think that CI servers can certainly be used to manage running regressions and nightly builds. Smoke tests and scheduled build approaches can be controlled with most of the CI servers. However, the real continual building process required to move from scheduled builds to CI seems to be hard to map to hardware design, simply because of the length of time of the checkout/build/test loops. Tool improvements and generally faster hardware seems to be key to increasing the frequency of integration tests, at least for now. However, optimizing the interaction between the users and automated tools is a key and often overlooked part of developing an effective design flow, if you plan on using CI or not.</p>
