<p>Pretty isn't it? This is the <a href="http://cmsinfo.cern.ch/outreach/">Compact Muon Solenoid</a> (or big electro-magnet) experiment tracker outer barrel from the <a href="http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/LHC/LHC-en.html">Large Hadron Collider</a>. They are getting close to firing this up, over on the border between Switzerland and France. CERN starts the first particle beam tests this month, with the first real particle collisions happening towards the end of the year. I keep having <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGqroT1FZ5Y">an REM song playing</a> in the back of my head when I <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2008/08/the_large_hadron_collider.html">look at these pictures</a>.</p>

                    <p><img src="http://fivecomputers.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54efca38e88340128756200ad970c-pi" width="883" height="149" alt="rocky_racoon.band.jpg" style="margin-top:0px; margin-right:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; padding-top:0px; padding-right:0px; padding-bottom:0px; padding-left:0px;" /><br />
<p>I've just recently started trying to learn to play guitar. My early experiences with music would be best described as making a bad noise,on the recorder. Still, I've decided to give it another go. One thing I've found early on that playing along to a metronome really helps with keeping time, but it isn't the most interesting thing to listen to. To liven things up a little, I've been playing around with Garageband on my Mac. This is an application that comes with the iLife suite and is preinstalled on most mac's. I suspect many owners don't use it for much, other than maybe making the odd iPhone ringtone (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/334073/create-custom-iphone-ringtones-the-free-and-apple-way">you can make them for free with Garageband, rather than paying money to get them in iTunes</a>). Garageband also comes with several free lessons built in that are useful, if a bit limited. I've been using it mostly to record my practices and provide backing rhythm for my practice time.</p>
<p>Instead of playing along to the metronome, I've been making up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_track">click tracks</a> to play to. These are simple drum loops that I use as a backing beat. It is easy to change the tempo of the drum beat and make it loop indefinitely. I've found <a href="http://www.thegaragedoor.com/tutorials/clicktracks.html">free loops</a> and there are also several vanilla loops that ship with GarageBand that are useful for click tracks (such as Straight Up Beat 01). I just choose the one that has the closest feel to the rhythm I'm trying to play, then drag the loop into the main display. You can extend the loop by dragging the top right hand corner of the track out to the right. After that is done, set a cycle region to loop over the number of bars that you want it to play for and play along.</p>
<p>One of the nicest features of Garageband is the ability to retime any of the loops to a given tempo, so I can start out slow and build to a faster beat, without having to change the basic arrangements of backing tracks. I can add more software instruments as I go, but for now I've been keeping things quite simple. I have played some of the melodies on the musical score editor, so that I can hear how things should sound and have that playing quietly under the track as I play along. You can also drag in tunes straight from iTunes and have those as backing tracks as well. These can also be retimed and slowed down (<a href="http://www.officecafe.com/blog/2009/01/using-garageband-to-transpose-a-song-imported-from-itunes/">control-option-G is the secret undocumented</a> shortcut you'll need)</p>
<p><img src="http://fivecomputers.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54efca38e88340120a6613708970b-pi" width="569" height="310" alt="System-2.jpg" /></p>
<p>This has been helpful so far. I've also started recording my attempts on a separate track (I've got an acoustic-electric guitar, so I can hook it straight into the computer). Listening to it I can hear the mistakes, but I can also pull up waveforms and visually see just where and when I was off beat. That's helped me start to tighten things up. I've been impressed by the features available in this free suite of tools. Certainly not as all encompassing as <a href="http://www.apple.com/logicstudio/">Logic Studio</a> or Pro Tools, but more than I need to be able to help me learn more quickly.</p>
<p>After a few days of this, I realised the biggest problem was having to hit a key to start things recording, then quickly grab the guitar and get ready to play. Garageband will provide a 4 beat count in, but that isn't really enough for me to get ready and away from the keyboard. I found an interesting solution, where I worked out how to use my iPhone to remotely control GarageBand, using the Open Sound Control protocol and some free GUI creation tools and a bit of python scripting. More about that later.</p></p>

                    <p>I've always had a dread of mid-afternoon status meetings. Now maybe I understand it a bit better, because of Paul Graham's excellent essay on the difference between <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">being on a maker's schedule and being on a manager's schedule</a>. Seems to share a lot of ideas with Csikszentmihalyi and his ideas of creativity and flow states.</p>

Listened to <a href="http://www.chipdesignmag.com/bailey/">Brian Bailey</a> talking on the missing metrics for verification coverage at the <a href="http://www.certess.com/">Certess</a> booth on Wednesday. This was a really interesting talk discussing the standard code coverage and functional coverage metrics and pointing out that we don't really currently have a good metric to track when we are doing useful verification or not. Functional coverage is used for this, but care needs to be taken to ensure we are covering the right things.</p>

<p>There's a danger that functional coverage, which was originally designed to track the quality of random stimulus, is used to only track that stimulus. In this way, we might not consider if the behaviour is actually checked or not. The same ideas are represented in David Robinson's verification planning presentation at DAC. Requirements and functional coverage without checkers is a waste of time and effort. It is possible to get 100% coverage, with lots of cover points and no enabled or implemented checkers in a design. Careful testbench design, or tools like <a href="http://www.certess.com/">Certess</a>, can be used to address these issues but only once you realise that functional coverage isn't a magic bullet. </p>

<p>I also saw a demo of the Certess product, <a href="http://www.certess.com/product/">Certitude</a>. It randomly inserts errors into the device under test (DUT) to give a way to evaluate the quality of the testbench surrounding the DUT. The basic idea is that if the design is mutated in a particular way, the testbench is good if it can detect the error, or has a hole if this failure mode cannot be seen in the checkers. This artificial bug insertion is something I do on an ad-hoc way when developing a testbench and Certitude automates and expands on this commonly used approach.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://electronicsystemlevel.com/EDA-Cover-up.pdf">read a paper </a>from Brian on this topic.

                    <p>Writing some documents using Microsoft Word and I wanted to be able to drop in syntax highlighted versions of the source code. Pygmentize will generate RTF format, which is great for pasting in to Word, but you have to get it there. The best way I've found is using the OS X terminal (I like using <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home">iTerm2</a>). I then use a feature of the command line <i>open</i> command, which makes it read from <i>stdin</i> and open the output in TextEdit. This text can then be cut and pasted directly in to Word, preserving all the formatting.</p>

<p>Run the command:</p>

<pre>
pygmentize -f rtf &lt;file to highlight&gt; | open -f
</pre>

<p>Then in the TextEdit window, press</p>
<div style="display: inline !important;">

                    <p>I haven't been to the <a href="http://dac.com">Design Automation Conference</a> (DAC) for several years. Last time I was there, SystemC was the hot new language on the block, ready to revolutionise the design and verification world. In the intervening years, the hype has died down a bit and SystemC has settled into a comfortable niche as a solid option for doing higher level modeling, that previously was done in a roll your own C or C++ environment. The features for modeling parallelism and communication along with structure are good enough to mean you don't need to do it all from scratch. The speed is slowly getting better, but it isn't going to change the design world. It somewhat dropped the ball by being implemented as a set of library extensions to C++, rather than an enclosed language (which would have had the potential at least to be synthesisable - something SpecC got right).</p>

<p>Now several years later, the hot new language on the block, ready to revolutionise the design and verification world is SystemVerilog. Low level enough to write hardware. Feature rich enough to support verification. An IEEE standard (that nobody quite implements). All things to all people. Maybe. Or maybe 3 distinct languages that happen to run together on one simulator - which seems closer to the reality. A step in the right direction perhaps, and certainly the current flavour of the month. OVM and VMM (verification libraries built on top of SystemVerilog) are the thing that kept coming up time and again as I looked through the DAC sessions, with an eye towards verification and system-level design. With the news that the VMM is open source, along with the already freely available OVM, perhaps the opportunity to merge to one set of libraries across the big three has some potential, if we ignore all the legacy investment that will still need to be supported.</p>

<p>These are the sessions that caught my eye at this year's DAC and that I hope to attend. I'm surprised quite how many of them overlap, so I suspect I'll be missing more than I might like. There is so much going on this year! I plan on blogging throughout the conference and sharing the interesting things I find.<br />

<p>I'm on an extended work trip at the moment. My wife and I have been keeping touch with <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a>, using the video conferencing and VoIP on a daily basis. It's great to be able to see each other and talk without speaking in to a phone. I've come to realise the value of a good microphone and proper speaker setup, as well as a decent camera. In general it has been really effective, at least within the US. Typically fast, quite clear audio and good picture quality.</p>

<p>We also needed to look at some documents on the computer. Skype doesn't have a remote desktop sharing option and we had some problems getting the Windows Live Messenger working to share screens and there would be the added difficulty of sharing from Windows XP to my Mac (I'd have been using a VM Fusion Windows session). Instead, we tried <a href="http://www.showmypc.com">http://www.showmypc.com</a>. I was impressed how easy it was to set up, just download an application and run it (a bit of trust required there). Then there is a password that you share with the user at the other end of the link and you are connected. Under the hood it sets up a VNC session via an SSH server, but from an end user perspective, all you need is the password to connect. It was fast, easy to use and worked well Windows XP &lt;-&gt; OS X. They have options where you set up your own SSH server in the middle, rather than trusting their servers, but I think you have to pay for that option. In general, it was surprisingly easy and effective. We were able to still have the Skype video call running in parallel too.</p>

<p>The picture of the beach? That's the Outer Banks in North Carolina - about 4 hours from where I'm working at the moment. I <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mcgregorphoto/sets/72157606793809724/show/">took the opportunity</a> to go there for the weekend and camp out in the sand. Traveling for work isn't ideal but I try to make the most of the places I do get to go, in particular seeing the area or taking advantage of museums and art galleries I wouldn't normally have the chance to visit. In that respect, I tend to disagree with Grant Martin's sentiment over <a href="http://www.chipdesignmag.com/martins/2008/07/07/not-taking-a-country-for-granted/">on his blog</a>. I've still been able to disconnect on business trips and see a bit of the local culture. Two weeks ago I saw a <a href="http://www.ncartmuseum.org/collections/highlights/european/french/1770-1900/011_lrg.shtml">Monet</a> at the North Carolina museum of art. This weekend I was in the Outer Banks. I think you have to push yourself a bit to really take advantage of the opportunities that might be there, but it can certainly be done. For every business trip I've been on in the last few years, I've really worked to get to at least one museum or art gallery, just to make it worthwhile.</p>

                    <p>Ever find you need to implement a web server or provide some web pages on a local network? Maybe you don't have an Apache server up and running or don't want to go to the trouble of configuring it. I've found this with <a href="http://www.naturaldocs.org/">Natural Docs</a> documentation, where the tools will generate a bunch of .html files that you can read locally if you are on the machine where they are generated. <a href="http://www.fivecomputers.com/2012/04/systemverilog-support-in-pygments.html">Pygments</a> also will generate html formatted files that you might want to serve. However, you might want to make them accessible to a small team. Here is a quick trick that can make this task very simple. Python ships with a basic HTTP server module. You can get it up and running, serving files from a given directory down with the following command:</p>

<pre>
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
</pre>

<p>and that's all there is to it! The default port will be 8000, but you can provide a different port on the command line (just add the port number after the SimpleHTTPServer - any number above reserved range of 0-1024 will work. The server will be accessible to any machines that can see that port on the machine it is running on. The server won't handle a high load and isn't particular secure, so I wouldn't make it available to the general public. But if you need to serve some pages quickly and simply, to a small number of users within a private network, this can be a really fast way to get to that point. If and when the load becomes an issue, or security concerns are important, then a heavyweight server like Apache is a much better choice.</p>

<p>Once the server is up and running you access it via a web browser at http://machine_name:8000 File paths are all relative to the directory the server is running in. If there is an index.html in that directory, it will be loaded by default when you access the server at that URL.</p>

                    <p>I've been using <a href="http://pyhvl.sourceforge.net/">PyHVL</a> for a variety of verification tasks in the past few years. PyHVL is an open source Python integration for Verilog and SystemVerilog simulators. To give a quick taste of what it can do for you, consider the following SystemVerilog VPI C code.</p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8">
  <pre style="line-height: 125%">
<span style="color: #B00040">void</span> display_nets(mod)
    vpiHandle mod;
    {
       vpiHandle net;
       vpiHandle itr;
       vpi_printf(<span style="color: #BA2121">"Nets declared in module %s</span><span style="color: #BB6622; font-weight: bold">\n</span><span style="color: #BA2121">"</span>,
       vpi_get_str(vpiFullName, mod));
</pre>
  <pre style="line-height: 125%">
       itr <span style="color: #666666">=</span> vpi_iterate(vpiNet, mod);
</pre>
  <pre style="line-height: 125%">

       <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">while</span> (net <span style="color: #666666">=</span> vpi_scan(itr))
          {
          vpi_printf(<span style="color: #BA2121">"</span><span style="color: #BB6622; font-weight: bold">\t</span><span style="color: #BA2121">%s"</span>, vpi_get_str(vpiName, net));
          <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">if</span> (vpi_get(vpiVector, net))
          {
             vpi_printf(<span style="color: #BA2121">" of size %d</span><span style="color: #BB6622; font-weight: bold">\n</span><span style="color: #BA2121">"</span>, vpi_get(vpiSize, net));
          }
          <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">else</span> vpi_printf(<span style="color: #BA2121">"</span><span style="color: #BB6622; font-weight: bold">\n</span><span style="color: #BA2121">"</span>);
       }
    }
</pre>
</div>

<p>Here is the equivalent VPI code, this time written in Python, using PyHVL.</p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8">
  <pre style="line-height: 125%">
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">display_nets</span>(module):

  <pre style="line-height: 125%">
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">print</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">'Nets declared in module'</span>, get_str(vpiFullName, module) 
</pre>
  <pre style="line-height: 125%">

</pre>
</div>

<p>The magic happens in the implementation of the <i>vpi_iterator()</i> method, which uses a Python <i>yield</i> instruction to turn the method into a generator. <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators">Generators</a> are much like functions, except they maintain a frozen stack frame, at the point where the <i>yield</i> occurs. All existing variables within the method maintain their state and execution picks up where it left off, just after the <i>yield</i>. The example also uses lazy evaluation of the result of <i>get(vpiVector, net)</i> to either call <i>get(vpiSize, net)</i> or not print the <i>'of size</i>' additional string.</p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8">
  <pre style="line-height: 125%">
<span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">def</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">vpi_iterator</span>(handle, <span style="color: #008000">type</span><span style="color: #666666">=</span>vpiNet):
    iterator <span style="color: #666666">=</span> iterate(<span style="color: #008000">type</span>, handle)
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">if</span> iterator:
        handle <span style="color: #666666">=</span> scan(iterator)
        <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">while</span> handle:
            <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">yield</span> handle
            handle <span style="color: #666666">=</span> scan(iterator)

</pre>
</div>

<p>This lets you write loops <i>inside out</i> as one of my colleagues aptly put it. The outcome is you can simplify the management of loops and indices and focus on the point of the loop. You write less code, you introduce fewer bugs. The code is easier to read and maintain as a result. This is just a very small example of some of the power of using a modern scripting language like Python, as an adjunct to a SystemVerilog simulator.</p>

<p>If you spend much time writing VPI code, you should take a look at PyHVL. It could make your life much simpler, or get in touch and I can help you with it.</p>
