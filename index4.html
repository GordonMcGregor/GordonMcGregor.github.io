</p>

<p>Attended the <a href="http://www.coolverification.com/2008/03/blogging-birds.html">blogging Birds of Feather</a> session at DAC, last evening. I was quite amazed at the number of people who showed up. I had expected there to be half a dozen people and not much interest. Instead, more chairs had to be brought in and in the end about 40 people showed up, with many traditional journalists and bloggers in attendance. The discussion was lively and spirited. </p>

<p>One of the main themes was confusion over just what blogging is and how it should fit in to the more traditional roles of the press and marketing with the EDA world. Some of the discussion revolved around trying to classify just what a blog is or isn't and how it differs from columns, marketing or opinion pieces. To me this seems a mostly futile debate or perhaps one that stems from a lack of real understanding on what the medium is about. Really all a blog is is a way of having a somewhat one-sided or asymmetric conversation. The classification or editorial style then comes from the person who runs the blog. Columns, <a href="http://stephenfry.com/blog/">blessays</a>, technical paper sources, marketing fluff pieces, lunchable debates, it is all blogging and reflects the writer of the blog. At the lowest level, a blog is really just an easy mechanism to publish on-line. Everything else becomes an issue of personal approach, rather than definition over the technical nature of the communications medium.</p>

<p>There was also quite a bit of concern over editorial control and company influence. Certainly it is clear that one of the main differences that a blog has over what has gone before is the democratization of content creation. The barriers to entry have been stripped away and anyone with something to say can start saying it. It is analogous to the changes with the automated printing press and how that lowered the cost of entry to distribute ideas. But anyone being able to publish isn't always a good thing. Professional writers and editors perform a useful function, giving an expectation for a certain level of quality.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Now, editorial control over the content is removed. But editors are valuable - they are a filter on the content. That filter finds interesting articles and also maintains quality. A blog removes that or shifts the onus onto the writer to be their own editor. EDA blogging isn't going to be immune to the wide range of quality and value that exists in the mainstream blogosphere. Some blogs will be terrible. Some will be great. The advantage is that my definition of what is great and interesting might be radically different to yours, so I'll be able to find the content that is valuable to me, rather than what an editor thinks I need to hear. </p>

<p>Control and classification again was brought up when the issue of the 60+ EDA blogs was mentioned. The concern was that so many disparate sources of information need to be corralled and filtered, otherwise nobody could read them or keep up. Here again, I think this is a bit of a red herring. There will be a large number of EDA blogs that will appear, but I'll personally probably only care about the content of a small percentage of them. It is exactly the same as when I come to DAC. There might be 500 companies here, but I'm not interested in the products that many or even most of them have. I personally filter out all the low level layout, silicon process technology companies and concentrate on the ones relevant to me. EDA blogs will be the same - I'll find the 5 or 10 that cover my areas of interest and read those. The beauty is that you can also find the (no doubt very different) 5 or 10 that cover your area of interest and watch those. You have the control over the content you are exposed to, rather than having <a href="http://www.eetimes.com">EE Times</a> select across the whole EDA sphere, which then provides maybe one article per issue that actually covers part of the industry that I care about.</p>

<p>Along the same lines, there is no real reason that someone couldn't step up and start aggregating the content in useful ways, collecting and collating interesting content from other
sources. Reputation tends to be the driver for this. If I find someone who writes interesting content I'll tend to follow their interests too. If they point to another article or blog, I'll read that. They then are providing the role of a more traditional editor to the content I read. The only real change is that there will be a lot more editors and authors, so we can all find the more personalised channel that suits our interest. </p>

<p>My experiences aggregating content for SoFoBoMo (<a href="http://gordonmcgregor.blogspot.com/2008/01/sofobomo.html">Solo Photographic Book in a Month</a>) is illustrative for this. In a couple of months, we established a group of 200 people working an indivdual book project, all working on their own project, concurrently, in the same month. Many of the participants also blogged about their experiences creating their first (for those new to the process) or latest book. Everyone was working on a similar process, but on their own personal work. <a href="http://gordonmcgregor.blogspot.com/2008/04/pipes.html">I set up simple tools</a> that pulled from all of the participants blogs and provide one, very focused, feed specifically about this shared project. Those people may well have been blogging about what they had for lunch or where they went at the weekend, but only the relevant <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/gordonmcgregor/sofobomo">entries about SoFoBoMo</a> appeared in the feed. It would certainly be quite trivial to do something similar for hot EDA topics too. I could do that and publish it and become a hub for those conversations. There is a world of free tools out there just to do this task. A feed that combed all the EDA blogs for ESL topics or OVM or whatever buzzwords you are interested in is trivial to set up and would deliver customised content on a daily basis. Certainly not all readers will set this up, but it only takes one person to do it and share it for everyone to benefit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vmmcentral.org/vmartialarts/">Janick Bergeron</a> raised some interesting concerns common to most bloggers, on how to maintain the flow of content. There have been <a href="http://writetodone.com/">a lot of articles</a> written on how to<a href="http://http://writetodone.com/2008/01/10/what-makes-great-blogwriting/"> feed the beast</a>, with <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2006/02/14/blogging-for-beginners-2/">blogs devoted</a> to these sorts of topics. This isn't really an EDA blogging or even a blogging specific topic, but one common to anyone who writes. Passion has to be the driver, particularly for a personal outlet that isn't corporately funded or part of a job. I think it is hard to fake a blog - you have to want to do it, enjoy writing and have something to say. There are certainly mechanisms <a href="http://writetodone.com/2008/03/03/31-ways-to-find-inspiration-for-your-writing/">to help</a> discover content or processes you can put in place to make it more of a habit, but you have to want to do it at a fundamental level. My <a href="http://gordonmcgregor.blogspot.com">blog on photography</a> exists because I'm interested in discussing the topic. I want to share the ideas and learn from others following a similar path. I write it now because I can't stop writing it and I enjoy the process of ordering my thoughts. <a href="http://www.xuropa.com/ixuropa_home.php"><br /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.xuropa.com/ixuropa_home.php">James Colgan</a> and I had an interesting conversation on what topics make sense for blogging. I think there can be an initial fear that you have to be an expert in a particular topic to be able to talk about it. That can certainly be one approach. But there can be a lot of value to others in describing a learning process. You can become a guide for those who are following the same path if you point out the pitfalls that you fell into along the way. I used <a href="http://gordonmcgregor.blogspot.com/search/label/strangers">my experiences photographing strangers</a> as an example - 18 months ago I started blogging about my attempts to get better at taking pictures of people I didn't know. My early efforts were painful but I kept talking about how it improved over time. Some of those articles are amongst the more popular and valuable ones that I've written - because others who are earlier on that learning curve can see what I did over time. Similarly, in the EDA industry I could see that an expert on OVM blogging about use of the methodology would be fascinating. I could also see that a blog written about the frustrations of trying to learn to use the OVM for the first time would be of value. The expert has already probably forgotten the details that the new user might get hung up on and maybe wouldn't even know about the common mistakes that would be made. There is value to both and sharing that sort of experience.</p>

<p>Overall this was a really interesting and fun session. Kudos to JL for pushing to make it happen and to everyone who attended and made it such a lively discussion.</p>

Listened to <a href="http://www.chipdesignmag.com/bailey/">Brian Bailey</a> talking on the missing metrics for verification coverage at the <a href="http://www.certess.com/">Certess</a> booth on Wednesday. This was a really interesting talk discussing the standard code coverage and functional coverage metrics and pointing out that we don't really currently have a good metric to track when we are doing useful verification or not. Functional coverage is used for this, but care needs to be taken to ensure we are covering the right things.</p>

<p>There's a danger that functional coverage, which was originally designed to track the quality of random stimulus, is used to only track that stimulus. In this way, we might not consider if the behaviour is actually checked or not. The same ideas are represented in David Robinson's verification planning presentation at DAC. Requirements and functional coverage without checkers is a waste of time and effort. It is possible to get 100% coverage, with lots of cover points and no enabled or implemented checkers in a design. Careful testbench design, or tools like <a href="http://www.certess.com/">Certess</a>, can be used to address these issues but only once you realise that functional coverage isn't a magic bullet. </p>

<p>I also saw a demo of the Certess product, <a href="http://www.certess.com/product/">Certitude</a>. It randomly inserts errors into the device under test (DUT) to give a way to evaluate the quality of the testbench surrounding the DUT. The basic idea is that if the design is mutated in a particular way, the testbench is good if it can detect the error, or has a hole if this failure mode cannot be seen in the checkers. This artificial bug insertion is something I do on an ad-hoc way when developing a testbench and Certitude automates and expands on this commonly used approach.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://electronicsystemlevel.com/EDA-Cover-up.pdf">read a paper </a>from Brian on this topic.

<p>DAC started early with a Mentor sponsored breakfast at 7:30. Got to see a bit about some of their testbench automation tools that help steer coverage to more interesting parts of the design. There are a few other companies here that have similar products. The aim is to move beyond user driven constrained random testing and let the tools help in solving the problem.</p>

<p>After that, I listened to Gary Smith on the state of the EDA industry. Highlights:</p>

<ul><li>It's all about the software</li>

<li>Threads are dead</li>

<li>C is finished to be replaced by some useful concurrent language - brush up on Occam I say</li>

<li>Verification is a solved problem and will be automated - don't bother being a verification engineer</li>

<li>Almost 38% of companies roll their own EDA tools</li></ul>

<p>His talk made for an interesting start to the day, at least.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the day attending various sessions and tool demos, which I'll write more about later. I've been surprised how low attendance is. There are a lot of people from the tool companies in their booths, but not many customers for them to talk to - and that was on Monday, the free attendance day when there aren't that many technical sessions or other distractions. </p>

<p>The Open Verification Methodology(OVM) is a hot item this year, with many sessions discussing issues around use and interoperability. Many vendors are showing products or claiming compatibility with this new standard. SystemVerilog is the other dominant theme though SystemC still has some traction. The last time I was at DAC SystemC was the new kid on the block that everyone was expecting to take over the world, not so much any more and it has settled into a system level modeling niche. </p>

<p>The disturbing thing I am seeing is how little progress has been made in the last decade in the ESL tool industry. Many years ago I was working on ARM926 designs that were not on the bleeding edge, even then. Today, many ESL companies are still just showing support for ARM9 or being excited about performance of their ARM7 models. That's at least 2 or 3 cycles behind the latest processor technologies and a huge leap in tool complexity to keep up. Synthesis capacities are rising much slower than the process technologies, tools companies are stalling out, reimplementing the same technologies to support systemC, systemVerilog or what ever the new hot language or methodology is, without apparently making any significant progress.</p>

<p>The other problem that the ESL companies face is the lack of models for their particular product line. Many seem to be falling into the same trap - expecting customer demand to dictate which models to develop. But that isn't going to work - the systems designers need the models right around when they decide they need the models. There is no lead time. There certainly isn't the 6 months to 1 year lead time it takes to find the right ESL company, negotiate and convince them to start creating a model, get the team together and write and verify the model, then deliver it back to the system architect. When the architect wants the model, there might be a 1 week lead time. Maybe a month, before serious work needs to start. The whole investigation better be mostly finished in 6 months. ESL companies need to seed their model libraries in anticipation of customer need. If they wait for the customer, they'll always be too late to be any use at all and keep going round that loop. In spite of that glaring hole, ESL is another hot ticket at DAC this year. Software design and implementation continues to increase in cost and complexity and HW/SW co-design companies are proliferating as a result.</p>

<p>With the apparent dearth of progress and lack of useful model or up-to-date models, I'm not too surprised that almost 40% of companies are looking inwards for their EDA tools. Might also explain where everyone is this year, too. </p>

<p>The one bright light in the ESL space is that although many of the tools and methodologies haven't changed much in the last 5 years, they do seem to have moved on from being all smoke and mirrors and snake oil to perhaps actually working. So maybe things haven't changed, they've just become real.</p>

<p>I've been experimenting with Mac OS X now for a few months. Trying to work out if it is a reasonable platform for <a href="http://www.verilab.com" title="Verilab, Inc.">Verilab</a> to use internally for our various computing needs. One thing that I've come to love and now struggle to live without is a small add-on called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu%C4%B1c%C4%B8s%C4%B1%C9%A9%E2%85%B4%CE%B5%CA%80">Quicksilver</a>. Superficially it isn't very interesting. A <a href="http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver">fast application launcher</a> - where's the fun in that? But after you delve a bit deeper, it becomes something else. It is really a command line interface for OS X, on top of the GUI.</p>

<p>I hit a key and up it pops. Type a few characters and I can launch an application. I don't have to search through drop down menus or find icons on a desktop - much faster. I want to get a music player to jump to the next track - hot key and type '<em>next</em>'. Stop the music, type '<em>stop</em>'. The magic is that I don't have to switch away from what I'm currently doing, go to a different window or application and do anything. Want to email someone? Hot key, type a bit of their name and select their email address - again, without switching away from what you are working in. I can even open and edit text files without starting up a text editor - extend a todo list, add a calendar entry to my google calendar, all from the command line within the GUI. All without switching away from the current context. I can run unix terminal commands, search in documents, select groups of files and email them to someone, do quick calculations. It is amazingly more efficient than using a mouse and hunting for applications and buttons.</p>

<p>I've always been a bit of a command-line junkie, wanting to know the keyboard shortcuts for things in a GUI environment, liking having a command prompt, but Quicksilver is different. It's a visual blend of command-line and GUI. Taking the best bits of both and putting them right under my fingertips. Highly recommended. Shame there isn't anything nearly as good for Windows XP or linux that I've found. Look <a href="http://www.43folders.com/topics/quicksilver">here</a> for more ideas about what Quicksilver can do.</p>

<p>Recently I've been <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-ap09056/index.html">reading</a> about the various open-source Continuous Integration servers that are available. <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CC/CI+Feature+Matrix">This chart</a> gives a good feature comparision of many of the systems that are out there. <a href="http://www.verilab.com" title="Verilab, Inc.">We've</a> been evaluating <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">Cruise Control</a> on some internal projects and generally trying to understand what the issues are with deploying a CI server on a hardware design project. One of the things I've been struggling with is the real, meaningful difference between continuous integration and the more typical <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000023.html">daily build</a> and check-in smoke tests. Scheduled builds are often described as an <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-ap03048/index.html?S_TACT=105AGX02&amp;S_CMP=EDU">anti-pattern</a> when considering CI, but as far as I can tell the only practical difference is in the frequency of the builds. Certainly, you have the potential to find out about a broken build more quickly with CI, hence it has less chance to impact other users. Also, you are always doing <em>useful</em> work, rather than maybe re-running a version because no check-in has happened since the previous build. However, these distinctions of implementing CI are maybe more significant in the software world than for the typically longer build times found in hardware design projects. This then is the key point - build time is the significant factor in CI. The real benefit of using CI successfully is that you need to refine your processes to keep the build as quick as possible, striving for close to a <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">10 minute turnaround time</a>, to stop things getting backed up. The consequence of this is that the entire Checkout-Build-Test loop keeps being optimised and refined. This doesn't just help with automated processes but can significantly improve productivity for the developers who do these steps manually every day. That's great for the software world, but is it really practical for hardware design with the current compilers and the speed of typical RTL simulation? If not, is it worth even bothering with?</p>

<p>The source control tools you choose can have a big impact on the first phase of the Checkout-Build-Test loop. When an update can take quarter an hour or longer, the source control system can become a significant productivity drain and stymie any chance of a quick turnaround. If merging changes, updating source and checking in a new revision takes hours, then there are real problems with the process and you certainly won't be doing multiple checkins per day (another fundamental CI process axiom is at minimum daily checkins for all developers, even more frequent is preferable). In <a href="http://www.fivecomputers.com/2008/06/git---version-c.html">Linus' talk about Git</a>, he describes being able to do a diff and merge on an entire kernel source tree (22k source files) in <a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/LinusTalk200705Transcript">less than a second</a>. I've used other SCM environments with similar amounts of code, where an update might take 30 minutes. These sorts of differences can significantly change how you work. It isn't just a matter of the time that the particular automated task takes, but what the developer does while they are waiting, reading email, writing documentation, switching context to other distractions.</p>

<p>Similarly, if the build takes half an hour or longer before it fails with a trivial syntax error, you'll have switched to something else and then have to try to mentally context switch back again to work on the problem. Each of these switches have an associated, measurable attention and productivity hit. Improving the build step can have a big impact on how you <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/06/13/zerstreutheit-and-attention-management-cure">manage your attention</a> and keep engaged with the development process. A faster turnaround can stave off the onset of <em><a href="http://www.43folders.com/comment/337830/literal-translation-Zerstreutheit">Zerstreutheit</a></em>.</p>

<p>The final Test step is significantly slower for hardware design. Often this is used as a justification not to bother optimising the Checkout and Build phases, because they are comparatively much shorter. A multi-day or week long regression might fool you into thinking that an hour long build is relatively good. However, simulation &amp; testing is the one step where the developer can be more out of the loop, with less impact. Typically, the user is not so tightly coupled into the testing loop, once the initial bugs are ironed out. Automation can certainly help here too, re-running failing tests with waveform dumping enabled or increased logging, to present a useful working environment for debug when the developer does come back to look at the fails.</p>

<p>The point really is that there is still a significant advantage to be had in spending effort to optimize the SCM and compile stages in a development flow, to maximise designer productivity and attention, even if the simulation time is large. Also a <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-ap11297/index.html?S_TACT=105AGX02&amp;S_CMP=EDU">build pipeline</a> can be used in the CI server to stage the build and testing feedback, to further mitigate the length of time that running tests takes. Deploying CI brings attention to how long these processes take and might help improve the entire development environment. Having fast enough tools can help the developers keep focused on what they are doing, without breaks for swordfights or reading email. Optimizing the build is still important, even in a hardware design environment, even when the runtime for regressions might be in terms of days or weeks. You might think the build process is only a comparatively small part of the overall runtime for a regression, but the designers spend most of their time looping through that comparatively small part.</p>

<p>So what is the take away? Does CI have a place in a hardware design flow? I think that CI servers can certainly be used to manage running regressions and nightly builds. Smoke tests and scheduled build approaches can be controlled with most of the CI servers. However, the real continual building process required to move from scheduled builds to CI seems to be hard to map to hardware design, simply because of the length of time of the checkout/build/test loops. Tool improvements and generally faster hardware seems to be key to increasing the frequency of integration tests, at least for now. However, optimizing the interaction between the users and automated tools is a key and often overlooked part of developing an effective design flow, if you plan on using CI or not.</p>

<p>I'm on an extended work trip at the moment. My wife and I have been keeping touch with <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a>, using the video conferencing and VoIP on a daily basis. It's great to be able to see each other and talk without speaking in to a phone. I've come to realise the value of a good microphone and proper speaker setup, as well as a decent camera. In general it has been really effective, at least within the US. Typically fast, quite clear audio and good picture quality.</p>

<p>We also needed to look at some documents on the computer. Skype doesn't have a remote desktop sharing option and we had some problems getting the Windows Live Messenger working to share screens and there would be the added difficulty of sharing from Windows XP to my Mac (I'd have been using a VM Fusion Windows session). Instead, we tried <a href="http://www.showmypc.com">http://www.showmypc.com</a>. I was impressed how easy it was to set up, just download an application and run it (a bit of trust required there). Then there is a password that you share with the user at the other end of the link and you are connected. Under the hood it sets up a VNC session via an SSH server, but from an end user perspective, all you need is the password to connect. It was fast, easy to use and worked well Windows XP &lt;-&gt; OS X. They have options where you set up your own SSH server in the middle, rather than trusting their servers, but I think you have to pay for that option. In general, it was surprisingly easy and effective. We were able to still have the Skype video call running in parallel too.</p>

<p>The picture of the beach? That's the Outer Banks in North Carolina - about 4 hours from where I'm working at the moment. I <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mcgregorphoto/sets/72157606793809724/show/">took the opportunity</a> to go there for the weekend and camp out in the sand. Traveling for work isn't ideal but I try to make the most of the places I do get to go, in particular seeing the area or taking advantage of museums and art galleries I wouldn't normally have the chance to visit. In that respect, I tend to disagree with Grant Martin's sentiment over <a href="http://www.chipdesignmag.com/martins/2008/07/07/not-taking-a-country-for-granted/">on his blog</a>. I've still been able to disconnect on business trips and see a bit of the local culture. Two weeks ago I saw a <a href="http://www.ncartmuseum.org/collections/highlights/european/french/1770-1900/011_lrg.shtml">Monet</a> at the North Carolina museum of art. This weekend I was in the Outer Banks. I think you have to push yourself a bit to really take advantage of the opportunities that might be there, but it can certainly be done. For every business trip I've been on in the last few years, I've really worked to get to at least one museum or art gallery, just to make it worthwhile.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/08/13/estimating-time">Interesting pos</a>t over on 43Folders on planning and task estimation. I've certainly experienced theses problems in the past but hadn't heard them described as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy">planning fallacy</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias">optimism bias</a>. The suggested ~44% buffer to add is quite depressing but probably close to true based on my experience. That means in a typical 5 day work week, you'll be lucky to do useful work for even 3 of them.</p>

<p>The flip side of planning is probably something we've all experienced too. You do your best to come up with a realistic schedule, then you are told that that is unacceptable and to reduce it to a wildly unreasonable, unrealistic estimate. Everyone knows it will be unachievable, but that's what you work towards. No wonder so many projects slip - they finish right around when they would have finished with realistic planning. Now that isn't to excuse projects on a terminal death march or those that have gone wildly out of control. But so often, I've been on projects where the end date was set before the planning was done.</p>

<p>In fact, I think in those cases, a realistic schedule might mean the project would never start, so everyone puts on their rose-coloured glasses and agrees to an insane schedule, that meets the deadline. Then the project starts to slip, often before anyone can even do any work it will be late. Over my career I've collected metrics on the various projects I've worked on, formally and informally. I've found quite a bit of resistance to using this real world project data for subsequent planning sessions. Mostly that's been the case when a certain schedule was required, with set number of people and the nasty reality of past experience was meaning the numbers wouldn't add up <em>correctly.</em> Those projects finished when we originally thought they would too.</p>

<p>So how do we move beyond this? Is it really that we are so bad at estimating how long things will take? Or that we can't accept the numbers that we come up with because of the time to market pressures and realities of the market place? Do the planners want to know the truth right at the start, or deal with the successive revelation of the nasty reality over time? Execution <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_slicing">by one thousand slips</a> or just planning business as usual?</p>

<p>I have a few days between a recently finished contract and before I start the next one. I've decided to use that time to learn a bit of <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> framework for a small project. I'm putting something together to do time tracking and communicate with the <a href="http://www.projectorpsa.com/">Professional Services Automation software</a> that we use in <a href="http://www.verilab.com" title="Verilab, Inc.">Verilab</a>. As ever this sort of learning only really happens on an '<em>as-needed</em>' basis so I think that a small driver project will move things along.</p>

<p>One of the first things I've been working on is the underlying communications with the web services interface that Projector provides into their database. They use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a> interface, with a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl">Web Services Description Language (WSDL)</a> representation of the API. This WSDL file is a machine-readable, XML description of all of the API calls and expected types for those calls. You can interact with the SOAP interface directly, constructing the XML to place the request and then parsing the responses manually. However, that becomes painful very quickly, as the calls are very verbose and unwieldy. The solution is to use one of the various SOAP frameworks available, that interrogate the WSDL and then generate objects and methods to encapsulate the interface.<br /></p>

<p>This all seemed mostly reasonable and I got a copy of <a href="http://dev.ctor.org/soap4r"><em>soap4r</em></a> which is the default Ruby SOAP interface. The latest version supports two interfaces, dynamically parsing the WSDL and generating object factories, or a script that statically parses the WSDL and generates a variety of helper classes that can be used to build the SOAP calls.<br /></p>

<p>At this point, the almost total lack of documentation for <em>soap4r</em> started to bite me. There is plenty of sample code, assuming you only ever want to pass a string (like a stock ticker) and only ever really expect a single integer or float to come back (such as a stock price). Very few examples go much further than that, but the Projector SOAP API uses a variety of heavily nested complexTypes and it wasn't very clear at all how to access or manipulate them. I made the initial mistake of trying to use the dynamic WSDL parsing, but after a while switched to using the statically generated classes which helped somewhat. At least then I could read the source and see what the member variables were in the classes and also what the class names were. Part of the problem seems to be that the Ruby world prefers the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">RESTful</a> approach to web services, so SOAP is something of an ugly step-child. But SOAP is what I have to work with to get the information I need.<br />
<br />
At one point, I abandoned the Ruby version and tried to build an equivalent set of queries in Python. I'm more familiar with that language and thought it might remove one of the levels of complexity from the problem. In the Python world, I tried using the <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/suds">SUDS</a> framework to manage the WSDL. In this case, SUDS only supports dynamic parsing of the WSDL file and this parsing is quite a computationally expensive task. It doesn't make for fast, iterative exploration when it takes about 30 seconds to start up the script each time. I wasn't able to pickle the results to cache the driver either. Again, the SUDS framework has a real dearth of documentation - in fact it is even more sparse than <em>soap4r</em>. However, poking around at the classes using the introspection features of Python helped me get a bit further along and also cast the Ruby experience in a different light. I was able to take what I'd learned in Python and apply it to the Ruby scripts and made quite a bit more progress.<br /></p>

<p>I've been learning bits and pieces of Ruby along the way, too. Ruby is also a dynamic language with introspection, so I was able to start poking around in the objects, printing out methods and instance_variables to see what was going on. The interactive command line in Python is fantastic for doing this sort of exploration. I haven't yet found an equivalently powerful command line/ interactive way of doing this sort of playing around in Ruby (feel free to let me know how!). By some trial and error and dumping objects along the way I was able to get the data I wanted.<br /></p>

<p>So a day and a half later, I now have a simple Ruby script that can talk to the ProjectorPSA SOAP API and query the list of active projects, then print out and count that list. Painful to get up the learning curve, but now at least I know how to work with the SOAP framework and make the method calls that I need. The equivalent Python script is almost there, but with a missing namespace in the generated XML that I haven't quite worked out how to control from the other side of the SUDS framework.<br /></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Overall, SOAP still seems very verbose and complex, for what it does - layers of objects, lots of XML, just to do very simple queries. A simple method invocation such as:</p>

                    <p>I found this <a href="http://kk.org/ct2/2008/06/unthinkable-futures.php">list from 1993</a>, where Brian Eno and Kevin Kelly throw out wild and wacky things that might happen. Some of them seem a whole lot more likely from 15 years in the future. To me the ideas on the appeal of US citizenship seems to already be starting to happen, with an economy where multiple citizenship and an ability to easily move and work is a competitive advantage. The US tax laws in particular don't endear me to becoming a US or dual citizen.</p>

<p>
The idea of squatter's suburbs, where the more affluent return in droves to city centers, driven in part by rising gas prices, and displace the poor appears to be a quite likely outcome now. Probably not such a trend a decade and a half ago.

                    <p>I've had a <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/blackberrycurve.shtml">Blackberry Curve</a> for a while. Really like having a real keyboard and the screen is big enough to actually browse web pages on and read quite a bit of text. However, the built-in web browser is about the worst I've ever used. Slow, clunky, painful. I have been using Google Reader's mobile view to catch up on RSS feeds and blogs while out and about. A few days ago I downloaded the free <a href="http://viigo.com/home">Viigo</a> feed reader. A huge improvement! Heartily recommend it.</p>

<p>The setup was a painful, as their web site wasn't particularly fast or flexible to edit feeds. Once I realised you could download an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML">OMPL</a> format list from Google reader and upload it to Viigo things went much more smoothly. You can also link it directly to an aggregator feed, such as Google reader. This then keeps track of feeds that you add or remove from the other viewer, but it doesn't sync up what was read between each view, which would be a really nice feature.</p>

<p>Other than the setup issues, I've found it great to use. Clean interface, fast and without the pain of being in the browser environment. The price is good too!</p>
